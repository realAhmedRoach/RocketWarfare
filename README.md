You are in a large world. Using your custom-built rocket, the missiles that you have installed in it, and your base, you try to defend yourself and your team mates from attacks.
From UFOs, enemy ships, and more... *This is Rocket Warfare*.

Rocket Warfare is going to be an MMORTS made using JavaFX, with minimal use of external libraries. The first official release is set to go off January 2017.
