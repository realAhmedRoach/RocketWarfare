An MMORTS where you build a base, rockets, and missiles and fight with them.

You are in a large world. Using your custom-built rocket, and the missiles that you have installed in it, you try to defend yourself and your team mates.
From UFOs, enemy ships, and more... *This is Rocket Warfare*.

This game is made using JavaFX. I'm trying not to use any external libraries, and to make it completely from scratch. The first test version will be released at least 6 months from now.

Here are the [graphics](res/images/spritesheet.png).
