You are in a large world. Using your custom-built rocket, the missiles that you have installed in it, and your base, you try to defend yourself and your team mates from attacks.
From UFOs, enemy ships, and more... *This is Rocket Warfare*.

This game is made using JavaFX. I'm trying to minimize my use of external libraries, and to make it completely from scratch. The first test version will be released at least 6 months from now.
Hopefully, this game turn out to be an MMORTS.
